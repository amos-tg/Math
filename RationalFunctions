~ Definition of A Rational Function:

       p(x)
f(x) = ----  = a rational function
       q(x) 

the graph of a rational function may not cross a vertical asymptote. The graph may cross a horizontal asymptote.

the domain of a rational function is all real numbers
excluding the real zeros of q(x)

~ Finding Asymptotes:
* Horizontal Asymptotes:
(y = d) is a horizontal asymptote of the graph of a 
function if f(x) approaches d as x approaches infinity
or negative infinity.

* how to find the horizontal asymptote:
n = degree of the numerator
m = degree of the denominator

if n > m, then f has no horizontal asymptote
if n < m, then the line (y = 0) is the h. asymp.
if n = m, then (y = a(sub{n})/a(sub{m})) is the h. asymp.  
 this means leading coefficient of the numerator over
 the leading coefficient of the denomiator.

a = coefficient of the leading term in std. form.

* Vertical Asymptotes:
vertical asymptotes of a function are where 
the rational is undefined / where the numerator
is non-zero but the denominator is zero.

f(x) = 1/(x-1); x = 1 is a vert. asymp. 

* Slant and Nonlinear Asymptotes:
degree numerator = n
degree denominator = m
if (m + 1) = n { theres a slant asymptote }
if (n > m + 1) { 
	end behavior resembles a power function (nonlinear)
      a(sub{n})x^n
  y = ------------
      b(sub{m})x^m
}


to find an equation of a slant or nonlinear asymptote,
divide the numerator of f(x) by the denominator and 
determine the quotient q(x). The equation y = q(x) 
is an equation of the asymptote. Notably when you do
this calculation, you do not need to pay any attention
to the remainder, the equation is SOLELY the quotient.

a rational function cannot have both a horizontal 
asymptote and a slant or nonlinear asymptote.
