~ Sigma or Σ: Unicode: U+03A3:
Σ denotes summation, the operation of adding a sequence of
numbers where the index below the symbol specifies the
starting value and the index above specifies the ending
value.

k
Σ  
r = 1

means the sum of all integers from 1 to k.

4
Σ 2i
i = 1

means to substitute the values 1, 2, 3, & 4 into the
expression 2i and then add the results.

(2 * 1) + (2 * 2) + (2 * 3) + (2 * 4) = 20 

as you can see there doesn't have to be an expression
being for looped over here, it can just be a range 
which gets summed up like in the first example.
