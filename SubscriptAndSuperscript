~ Subscript: Unicode U+2081 = ₁, extends alphanumerically :
an expression set slightly below the normal line of type, it
is usually smaller than the rest of the text. 

subscripts are often used to distinguish between different
states of the same variable, for example, velocity may be
represented in an expression of a real world scenario, 

x₁ may represent the initial velocity,
x₂ may represent the final velocity, 
x₃ may represent the greatest velocity reached,

and so on.

another example would be to refer to members of a set or
elements of a vector.

~ Superscript: Unicode U+2070 -- U+209F : 
the numbers start at U+2070 and go to U+2079
