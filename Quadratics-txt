~ Forms:

  * standard form:  

y = ax^2 + bx + c
 
  * vertex form:

y = a(x - h)^2 + k

~ Quadratic Formula: 

-b +- sqrt { b^2 -4ac }
-----------------------
       2a

~ Vertex Formulas:

  * standard form:

where the vertex is (x, y)
and the quadratic is in the form:
   ax^2 + bx + c

        b           b^2
(x = - -- , y = c - --- )
       2a            4a

  * vertex form:

remember that sign is flipped for (x + h) / negative
and that by default sign for h is positive for (x - h), the k sign is its natural sign. 
y = a(x - h)^2 + k

the formula is (h, k) all you have to do is pay 
attention to the sign rule according to the above.

(h, k) extraction with rules applied = (x, y)
                
~ Converting Standard to Vertex Form:

You can __Complete_The_Square__ to convert between
forms. This involves adding or subtracting to quantity binomial of the first two terms in a standard form quadratic, the value which would allow you to use the difference of two squares factoring method. You add or subtract the same thing outside the quantity to keep things equivalent, this modifies the original c term, or a(sub{0}) term. 


f(x) = (-x^2 -2x) + 3 
f(x) = -(x^2 + 2x) + 3
f(x) = -(x^2 + 2x + 1) + 4
f(x) = -(x + 1)^2 + 4

Whatever you add or subtract to the binomial leading terms quantity must be scaled by the coefficient in the opposite sign representation outside of the quantity.

g(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 3
g(x) = 3(x^2 - 2x) + 3 
g(x) = 3(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 3 - 3 
g(x) = 3(x -1)^2

here the 1 being added is scaled by three in its opposite sign representation outside the quantity and is made a -3, this cancels the constant term 3.
