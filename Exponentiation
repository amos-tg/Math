~ Basics:
any non-zero number raised to the power of one is one, this is derived from the law dictating any number multiplied by it's reciprocal is one, which i believe is called the multiplicative identity property, this does not apply to zero becuase division by zero is undefined. 

* Definition:
let b be a constant real number such that b > 0 and b != 1. Then for any real number x, a function of the form f(x) = b^x is called an exponential function of base b.

~ Forms:
the following forms are all equivalent

(root{ base = x, index = y })^n;
root{ base = x^n, index = y};
x^(n/y);

~ The Negative Exponent Theorem:

        1
x^-n = ---
       x^n

this applies if there are multiple factors, you don't flip all 
the factors, just the ones with negative exponents.

~ Universal Constant e:
e^-2 = 0.1
e^-1 = 0.4
e^0 = ~ 1
e^1 = ~ 2.7
e^2 = ~ 7.4
e^3 = ~ 20.1
e^4 = ~ 54.6

~ Graphing:
the graph of an exponential function is defined by f(x) = b^x (b > 0 and b != 1) has the following properties. 

f = exp. fn;

if f b > 1, f is an exponential growth function.

if 0 < b < 1, f is an exponential decay function.

* if b > 1, f is an increasing exponential function, 

* if 0 < b < 1, f is a decreasing exponential function. 

* The domain is all real numbers

* the range is (0, inf).

* The line y=0 is a horizontal asymptote

* the line passes through the point (0, 1) because f(0) = b^0 = 1

~ Compound Interest Formula:
where 
P = principal/initial invested
t = number of years 
n = compounding periods per year
r = interest rate 
A = total amount 

           r
A = P( 1 + - )^nt 
           n
